## Pricing API
Flask API that, given an order request returns its totals (price and VAT) as the price and VAT value of each item.\
Pound is the default currency, but the query parameter `cur` can be passed to convert it.\
[pricing.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfbatista/pricing-api/master/pricing.json) can be used to test `orders` endpoint.
